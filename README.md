# Mild Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Diabetic retinopathy is a serious complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems and potentially blindness if left untreated. It is one of the leading causes of blindness in adults worldwide. The condition develops slowly over time, often without noticeable symptoms in its early stages, making it critical for individuals with diabetes to undergo regular eye exams. 

Early detection of diabetic retinopathy allows for timely intervention, such as laser therapy or medication, which can prevent further damage to the retina and preserve vision. Managing blood sugar levels and maintaining overall health are also important steps in preventing or slowing the progression of the disease. Since diabetic retinopathy can progress without obvious symptoms, early detection through regular screenings is essential to reduce the risk of vision loss and improve quality of life for those affected.
